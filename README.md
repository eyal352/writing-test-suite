# JavaScript Testing
## Udacity Feed Reader Project

This project begins as web-based application that reads RSS feeds and outputs the feeds as clickable lists to the original webpage.

The task is to develop and write tests for the web-app to check that all components are loaded and functioning properly. The tests were developed using the Jasmine testing library, and can be found in the feedreader.js file.
